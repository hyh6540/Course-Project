This is project of Principle of Communication.

If you want to simulate FSK with noncorrelated demodulation, you should run `test.m`. `test_co.m` is for FSK with correlated demodulation.

There is a point my want to mention in this project, the noise's simulation. In the real world, it's continous, however, we could not achieve this in the matlab. Hence, we have to find a formula to describe it, which is given in the report.

As for the meaning of variable, you could find in the report.
