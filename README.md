## Numerical Analysis
### Probject1-weight and height of children

The main aim is to calculate the children' weight and height according to reference data. The main method I use is `cubic spline interpolation` with f'(x_0) and f'(x_n). Before this, I use `least square fit` to gather the derivatives at x_0 and x_n. Besides, I design the GUI with Matlab 2016b. Therefore, there may be some problems if your matlab version is lower than mine.
